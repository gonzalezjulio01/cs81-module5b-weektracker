# Reflection – Weekly Tracker

## Were your predictions accurate?

Yes, pretty much. I guessed that Saturday would be the highest enjoyment day and it was. I also predicted that “work” would be the most common category, which made sense since I work part-time most weekdays. Evening stuff did have better enjoyment scores — that's when I relaxed or hung out.

## What surprised you about your week?

Seeing the numbers made me realize how much time I actually spend working. I knew I worked a lot, but seeing it add up to 24 hours was kind of wild. I was also surprised how high the enjoyment was for social stuff even with short time. Just a couple hours hanging out made a bigger impact than a full work shift.

## Which higher-order function was most useful and why?

`filter()` was the one I used the most. It made it easy to focus on just one part of the week, like only the evenings or only short activities. I liked combining `filter()` with `reduce()` to get totals — that helped me find patterns faster than doing everything manually.
